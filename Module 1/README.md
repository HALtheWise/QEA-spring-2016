# Module 1: Boat design

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

The driving question for this module is this:

<i>How do you design a boat such that it can stably support and transport a given load?</i>

In this module, you will learn the necessary building blocks to understand how to design a boat hull which will float when loaded and be stable to wave action while still moving efficiently through the water.

The specific concepts you will be learning include:
<ul>
<li>Functional, parametric and data-driven description of curves and surfaces
<li>Vectors and vector operations
<li>Multivariable integration
<li>Forces, moments (torques) and free body diagrams
</ul>

The project for this module involves creating and characterizing a boat design computationally and experimentally.  You will design a boat that meets particular requirements (payload, stability, speed), and produce a design report that describes and justifies your design using appropriate analysis. Along with the design report you will also produce a set of functions in MATLAB that enable analysis of a given boat design.
