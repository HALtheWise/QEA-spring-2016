# Shapes III Reflections
*Eric Miller --- February 11, 2016*

## The Good
* I finally made the leap and completed an entire  problem set as a *Mathematica* notebook. That substantially reduced the time required for me to make the writeup.

* Parametric descriptions of surfaces are *really* nice. I've never worked with this math before, and I'm glad to have it in my toolbox now.

## The Bad
* Because I used a *Mathematica* notebook, the quantity of textual explanations accompanying the problems dropped significantly. I think that analysis is valuable, and I should find ways to make sure it reclaims its spot front and center.

* I still haven't decided how much of parametric surface descriptions is a skill that I actually need to know. I definitely like knowing that parametric surface descriptions *exist*, and I now have a pretty good idea what they entail, but I'm pretty sure the actual formulas contained  in Shapes III don't make my "memorize" list.


## The Ugly
* The process of completing this problem set felt very much like "throw the problems as stated into *Mathematica* and return the output". While I don't have objections to solving things this way, it makes me suspicious that the content of this problem set has limited intellectual depth.
