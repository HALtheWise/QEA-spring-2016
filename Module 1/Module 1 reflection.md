# QEA 2016-Module 1: To Float a Boat
## Personal reflection: Eric Miller



### The Value of Math

Day one of QEA exemplified in many ways the way I often approach problems. We had a crunched amount of time (3.5 hours), a good team (Dhash and I) and a seemingly-simple mandate. As a result, we hacked together something that intuitively seemed that it ought to work. When we tested it, however, that intuition proved to be totally useless. The *Maersk* completely failed to float upright, dramatically so, and it became obvious that flying by intuition wasn't going to work in this case. More importantly, when the *Maersk* failed, I had no idea why, or how to fix it. I had vague intuitions that "maybe making it a wider would help", but my intuitive basis was ultimately insufficient at analyzing what had happened.

In the end, the remedy for this problem was to go back to *first principles*, learn the fundamental math, and approach the problem from the ground up.
