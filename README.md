# QEA (individual code)

QEA [Quantitative Engineering Analysis I] is a class I am taking during my second semester at Olin College (Spring 2016).
It is both a math/science class and an experiment in Olin's approach to analysis curriculum.

As taken from the

>Using quantitative analysis of models and data to make choices is critical for success in the engineering design process.  Whether you are selecting the best part from a catalog, choosing an appropriate material, sizing a component, determining the effect of certain influences on your design, or optimizing your design within a parameter space, you often need to obtain (through experiment or calculation) and interpret quantitative information to inform your decisions.  There are many different approaches to getting and interpreting the data you need to make your decision: you may wish to conduct an experiment, do a rough estimation, perform a detailed calculation based on mathematical models of your system, or create a computer simulation.  If you want to engineer effectively, you must be able to to choose and use appropriate quantitative approaches for a given situation. 
>In this class, we will be introducing you to various different approaches to quantitative analysis of engineering questions through real-world engineering examples.   You will learn how to select between different tools and different approaches within the context of an engineering challenge, how to use many different tools for quantitative analysis, and how to acquire new tools on your own in the future.
>This class is an EXPERIMENTAL COURSE.  We're combining a lot of pieces here, and trying new things.

This repository contains some of the code I created for individual assignments. Some projects I worked on with a partner will live
in their own repositories, linked below.
