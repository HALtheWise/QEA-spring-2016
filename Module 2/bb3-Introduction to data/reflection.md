# Reflections from BB2.3
## Introduction to Data

### Time and Effort

This building block fell *far* short of the 9 hours it was nominally supposed to. I can see valid reasons why that makes sense in some circumstances, but in this case it is probably a bad pedagogical call. I personally appreciated the break, but coming immediately after spring break, it didn't do much to help me rest, recharge, or work on other interesting stuff.

### Prior knowledge

When I last took a Linear Algebra class, I made the critical mistake of thinking I knew the stuff and, as a result, failing to put in the effort to actually learn the parts that were new. It seems disturbingly likely that that pattern will repeat this module. Vigalence may help, so I need to keep an eye on whether I'm really absorbing the content I haven't seen before.

### Content

I actually *really* like that we were given an assignment focused on how to understand data. I wish this were something every human (or at least every Oliner) saw and understood. Maybe it fits in iSIM somewhere? 

Anyway, the actual content of this BB is actually extremely valuable, and I'm glad to see it in this cohesive, formalized way. Thanks.
