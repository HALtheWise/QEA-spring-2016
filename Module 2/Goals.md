####Below, please list your 3-5 most important personal learning goals that you have for this module. What do you hope to learn? What do you hope to get better at, and why?


1. Linear Algebra  is a fundamentally useful toolkit to have, and I want to be comfortable with the terminology so I can understand things I read in that space.

2. I want to get better at learning from peers. In cases where my partner has a better grasp of something than I do, I want to be comfortable learning from that rather than just letting them do it.

3.  I want to get better at underachieving. It is a fallacy for me to sink more time and effort into something than I reasonably expect to get out, and I need to get good at identifying value at the individual problem/assignment level.

4. I want to freshen up my CS experience. It has been a long time since I've thought much about runtime/memory complexity, and it there is a chance, I want to bring that back into practice. I've never done those comparisons empirically, and that would be really cool too.

5. I have recently noticed a tendency to shy away from math and toward approximations. I'd like to rectify that imbalance by becoming more comfortable with doing lots of computation abstractly, then making implementation details later.
